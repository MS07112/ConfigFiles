Replace 'FLUIDSYNTH' with 'MID' in XMIPlayer.cpp and DirectoryPlayer.cpp files located in src/FileNames/music/ subdirectory.

Copy all DUNE 2 .PAK files into data subdirectory (if only 3-4 .PAK files currently exist in data: you have to acquire the rest from elsewhere online).

Run ./configure

Run make
sudo make install


== Most Important Part ==

Copy all .PAK files from the data subdirectory into the ~/.config/dunelegacy/data directory. Otherwise executing 'dunelegacy' in the terminal will just terminate without any explanation.

-- The reason for this is the system is looking for the .PAK files in this directory, regardless of where in /usr/local/share (or wherever) the .PAK files are supposedly installed.


Additionally, copying these files to the /root/.config/dunelegacy/data directory is also a good idea. Just in case the installation specifies that as the place to look for the .PAK files.
